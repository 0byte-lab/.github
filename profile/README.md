> **SSL for AI content**

## About

“How can I prove this file was genuinely AI-generated—and by whom?”

We embed an invisible, zero-knowledge proof of origin directly into every AI-generated image, video, or audio file. Anyone can independently verify the content’s authenticity in milliseconds—no central APIs, no leaked prompts, no guesswork.

**Key points**

- **One-line SDK** integrates with any AI-model pipeline.  
- **ZK-SNARK proof** binds the file hash, model, metadata, timestamp, and platform ID.  
- **On-chain anchoring** (Solana) makes the commitment immutable and public.  
- **Privacy-preserving**—we never store or reveal your prompt or weights.
